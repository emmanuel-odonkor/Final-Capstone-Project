Ashesi Tutor Management  System

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Ashesi Tutor Management System is a web-based software application that allows Ashesi Students to find Tutors
for any course they are having difficulty in understanding. The system is access-controlled with designated Students,
Administrator, Department Coordinators, and Tutor user privileges. Tutors can set up their profile which would be visible
for students to find them. Departmental Coordinators for the available departments can provide courses and the number of 
tutors required per course from their department. The Administrator can set up these courses for tutoring which would be 
visible to students who desire to be tutors. The application has also a Chat Application for user-to-user communication
and a Matching portal for Student-Tutor Matching.
